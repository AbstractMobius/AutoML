## Using SciGen:

* Artificial Neural network
```python
from SciGen.NeuralNetworks.Artificial import ArtificialNeuralNetwork

""" Creating the model """
stock_net = ArtificialNeuralNetwork(dimensions=[1, 10, 15, 2])

""" Obtaining model data """
stock_data = [([0.3, 0.423, ..], 0.12), ([0.04, -0.2, ...], -0.04), ...]  # ([daily_cost_delta, weekly_cost_delta, ...], expected_return_percentage)

""" Training the model """
for data in stock_data:
    inp, expected = data[0], data[1]
    stock_net.back_prop(inp, expected)

""" Model predictions """
stock_data = [0.32, 0.56, ...]  # [daily_cost_delta, weekly_cost_delta, ...]
model_prediction = stock_net.predict(stock_data)
```
